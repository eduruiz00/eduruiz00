### Hi there, I'm Edu Ruiz ([eduruiz00](https://edusoftdev.com/)) ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying MSc in Artificial Intelligence and enhancing my knowladge self-taught with online courses.
- ðŸ”Ž Iâ€™m looking to keep learning to be valuable in an enterprise.

During my student period I have developed different Data Science and Artificial Intelligence projects to consolidate theoretical topics and translate them into practical and real life applications.

Some of the projects that I have performed are exposed in the following list:

## Artificial Intelligence projects
